Solo developer assisgnment. I was tasked with taking data from 6 txt files and create tables from that information. 
I then needed to interpret and connect the data to answer queries I was given to peform. Finally, I needed to create and execute a query to make predictions for
the future of the business.

I chose to create a standardized menu based on the most popular drinks. These drinks should be the base menu when opening any location of any type or size to
produce maximum profit potential. I also made other analyses based on my findings.
